<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm a PhD student, currently living in London and recently moved down from
  Edinburgh.</p>

<p>My PhD is in Structural, Chemical and Computational Biology at UCL (mostly),
  and I've just started. Hoping to focus on Computational Biology as time goes
  on. Looking forward to it!</p>

<p>Before I moved to Edinburgh I lived in Blackpool, which part of me I guess
  will always call home. Before that I lived in a town called Bacup, which you
  haven't heard of.</p>

<p>I started this site in 2014, mostly as an excercise in web development. And
  even though I am sort of trying to make it a formal 'window onto the internet'
   now, it's still my go-to place for trying out new web technologies I might
   want to explore. So if something isn't working, that's my catch-all excuse.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch, your best bet is probably to
  <a href="http://twitter.com/sam_m_ireland" target="_blank">tweet me</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
